A (fictional) one-page proposal for the creation of a Regional Flood Inundation Modeling & Planning Center (FIMPC), for the Great Lakes Region. 

The intended audience is the elected officials in the region. The policy brief / memo is to communicate a complex technical matter and its policy ramifications to a busy decision-maker.
