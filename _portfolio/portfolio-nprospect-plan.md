Conceptualizing the process of land use change, our group proposed an Area Improvement Plan for the North Prospect Regional Commercial Center under the anticipated retail climate change challenge. During the research process, I examined the ongoing decline in Big Box Retail and its land use planning implications in Champaign. I analyzed the development prospects of retail industry and provided rationale for our approach which was focused on urban design and business viability.

Then for our plan, we recommended three phases for the implementation of our strategies, to promote a mixed-use center with enhanced urban design and balanced businesses. I was tasked to research and create business strategies that focus on supporting small and local businesses.
